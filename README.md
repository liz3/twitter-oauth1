# Simple Twitter API implementation
This is a repository containing simple implementations for interacting with the twitter api, specifically its OAuth1 parts.

There are implementations in Golang/Node

# Meaning
These are in no means full implementations, these are baseline implementations for sending tweets over the twitter api.

They are both simplified and merged components of [AnimePics](https://anime.pics)

# Motivation
Twitters OAuth 1 flow is extremely complicated to the point even their docs suggests using libraries for OAuth. There are very few examples and the existings often lack pieces or a proper explanation. So im publish this for people seeking simple examples not using a fully implemented library.

# Resources
**Note**: The Node.js script does require axios/hmacsha1. but these can easily be replaced.

# License
Consider this free software which follows the GNU GPL 2.0 license.
